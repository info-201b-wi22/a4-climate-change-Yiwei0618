                  Not only the change of temperature on earth will impact lives, 
                  but it also brings various consequences. 
                  For this project, I want to explore the sources of climate change,
                  which is usually caused by the emission of greenhouse gas such as CO2. 
                  The data I am going to use are collected by Our World in Data. 
                  The mission of this organization is to make data and research on the worldâ€™s most significant problems understandable and accessible. 
                  Thus, this detest collected deep insight into climate change due to GHG emissions. 
                  The limitation of this dataset is that there are missing values in specific columns, which make it hard to compare factors thoroughly. 
                  Another limitation is that the most recent available data is from 2020, which is entirely updated but not most updated. 
                  I will focus my exploring topic on the amount of CO2 emitted by coal consumption and the emission by different countries.
                  I chose to use the value of CO2 emission due to coal consumption per capita, 
                  and I think it will be more accurate to use the average emission rate per person since it can eliminate bias such as the size of the country. 
                  I calculated the top 5 countries with the highest CO2 emission due to coal consumption per capita in the 25 years from ", year_range[1], " to " , year_range[2] , " and they are Estonia, Australia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Czechia " ,
                  max_co2_per_capita_country, " has the highest emission value, which is ", max_co2_per_capita, " tonnes per person each year. The average CO2 emmision due to coal combustion among these five countries is " , avg_co2_country ,
                  " tonnes per person each year.I compared the trend of the CO2 emission due to coal consumption per capita of these five countries from 1996-2020 using a line plot with interactive widgets."))
